# Hack Computer - Nand to Tetris üñ•Ô∏è

## Overview üîç

The **Hack Computer** project is part of the *Nand to Tetris* course, where we build a complete computer system from the ground up using basic logic gates, all the way to executing machine-level programs. Starting with the simplest logic gate (NAND), we progressively create more complex components, using NAND gates for most of the parts, culminating in a fully functional computer. This project provides hands-on experience in building a computer's architecture using **Hardware Description Language (HDL)**, focusing on essential components like the CPU, memory, and control units.

## Key Concepts üöÄ

The process of implementing a computer from NAND to Tetris involves several key stages:

1. **Starting from Basic Logic Gates**:  
   We begin by designing and building elementary logic gates using NAND gates. These include:
   - AND
   - OR
   - NOT
   - Inc16
   - PC
   - And More

2. **Building Complex Components**:  
   These basic gates are combined to create more complex components such as:
   - Multiplexers
   - Decoders
   - Adders
   - Registers

3. **Assembling the Computer**:  
   After creating the fundamental building blocks, we assemble the main components of the computer:
   - **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**
   - **Control Unit**
   - **Memory Unit**

4. **Connecting Components**:  
   The components are then connected to form the complete computer system. The entire system is tested to ensure it operates as expected.

5. **Low-Level Programming**:  
   A low-level machine language program is written to demonstrate the functionality of the system, resulting in a fully operational computer.

## Features üåü

- **Complete Computer System**: Designed and implemented using HDL, based on the *Nand to Tetris* methodology.
- **Modular Design**: The project is broken down into individual components like CPU, RAM, and Registers, which are tested independently.
- **Low-Level Programming**: The computer is capable of running programs written in Hack Assembly language.
- **Component-wise Testing**: Each part, including **multiplexers**, **RAM**, and **registers**, is tested using automated test scripts to verify its correctness.
- **Simulation Ready**: Uses the Nand2Tetris Hardware Simulator to test components and run machine programs.

## How to Use ‚öôÔ∏è

### Prerequisites üìú

To run and test the components of the Hack computer, you will need the following:

1. **Hardware Simulator**: Use the [Nand2Tetris Hardware Simulator](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software) to run and visualize the HDL files.
2. **Assembler**: Use the Hack assembler for converting assembly programs into machine code.

---

### Running the Test Cases üîç

To test individual components:

1. **Open the Test File**: For example, open `CPU.tst` in the Nand2Tetris Simulator.
2. **Load the HDL File**: Load the corresponding `.hdl` file (e.g., `CPU.hdl`).
3. **Run the Simulation**: The simulator will automatically run the test cases in the `.tst` file and display the results.

## Example Output üìä

For instance, when running the `factorial.asm` program, the output will be the factorial of a given number. After running the program in the simulator, the results will be displayed in the **output window**.
